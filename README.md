# Project Meeting 1 - Proposal

## Project proposal
  - Introduction/background
  - The problem + overview/literature review: related software, app, website, and academic publications
  - Your project idea:
    - The main hypothesis;
    - The approach;
    - The evaluation method;
  - Plan
    - 3 iterations: 
      - each iteration has requirements, design, implementation, and evaluation.
      - first iteration: paper prototype
      - second iteration: working prototype with minimal function
      - third iteration: fully working prototype
    - A list of deliverables and deadlines are fine (example below)
    
    | Deadline | Milestone | Deliverable |
    | ---- | --------- | ----------- |
    | Week 5 | Submit project proposal | Project proposal|
    | Week 8 | Complete literature review | Literature review report|
    | Week 11 | Complete first iteration | Paper prototype|
    | Week 12 | Submit interim report | Interim report|
    | Week 16 | Complete second iteration | Working prototype|
    | Week 20 | Complete third iteration | Final prototype|

## GitHub.com
Use github.com for project file and code (Kai)
  - 'Code': report and implementation code
  - 'Issues': tasks and coding issue
  - 'Projects': planning and project management
  - 'Wiki': notes, meetings, reports, and any other documentation
  - How to use git: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2 (first 2 chapters)

## Code editor (IDE): 
Recommended: Visual Studio Code https://code.visualstudio.com/. 

Much better for JavaScript development than Brackets (http://brackets.io/), Sublime Text (https://www.sublimetext.com/), or Notepad++ (https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)

## Latex
Use Latex instead of Word for all the reports: proposal, progress report, final report, and viva. 
- Recommended editor: Overleaf (https://www.overleaf.com/), like Google Docs for Latex.
- Learn Latex in 30 minutes: https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Learn_LaTeX_in_30_minutes;
- How to add references: https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Bibliography_management_in_LaTeX;

# Project Meeting 2 - literature review

Due week 12.

## Litearature Review

### Existing Work
- Needs to be much more **complete** than the litearture review in the project proposal;
- Cover different media: app, website, service, organisation, physical print/product ...
- Focus on the most relevant: help you to narrow down your scope.
- Include academic publications to support your argument: 
  - IEEE Xplore: http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/home.jsp
  - ACM Digital Library: https://dl.acm.org/

### Development Technologies

- Be **open** about what form the project prototype will be: app, website, service, organisation, physical print/product ...
- Research different ways of implementation:
  - For example for app development, there is native and hybrid, and then there are many different hybrid frameworks. 
  - Comparison: 
    - Identify required **functions**, such as user regiter/login, database, messaging, image/video, ...
    - Compare different options regarding to the functions: is it possible at all, how easy it is to learn/program, how fast/secure/reliable it is, ...
- Justify your choice

### Reference
- Two parts: citation in the main text and the references at the end of reprot.
- Use a tool; don't create reference manually.
- If you are using Latex, 
  - follow this [overleaf bibliography tutorial](https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Bibliography_management_in_LaTeX);
  - watch my [latex tutorial](https://youtu.be/PqW8myobrPE), which includes references.
- If you are use Windows, use [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/) or [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/). 
  - use their browser extension to automatically add reference: 
    - [Mendeley web importer](https://www.mendeley.com/reference-management/web-importer)
    - [Zotero connector](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/zotero-connector/ekhagklcjbdpajgpjgmbionohlpdbjgc?hl=en)
    - These can export the papers to bibtex format, if you use Latex.
  - use their Microsoft Word plugin to add references to report
    - [Mendeley Cite](https://www.mendeley.com/reference-management/mendeley-cite)
    - [Zotero word processor plugin](https://www.zotero.org/support/word_processor_integration)

## First Iteration

### Requirements

- Find real users or company/organisation/charity that work with real users.
  - Find someone local if possible: much easier for the communication.
- Get the requirements from the real users, not what you think.
- The requirements should be technology independent, in most cases.

### Design/Implement

- Paper prototype/wireframe tool: 
  - Pencil and paper
  - Low fidelity: Balsamiq https://balsamiq.com/
  - High fidelity: ***Figma***: https://www.figma.com
  - Share the design: InVision https://www.invisionapp.com/

### Evaluation/Feedback

- Show user the paper prototype/wireframe and get feedback.
- Revise the desgin and project scope accordingly.


# Project Meeting 3 - first iteration update

## Literature Review - Progress Update
- Literature review should be more or less finished. This is a good time to discuss if there is any issue or difficulty.
- Everyone updates on:
  - Any change on the project idea and/or scope and the reason;
  - Any decision on development technology and the reason.
- Results on the mobile app development technology survey.

## First Iteration - Progress Update
- Contacted any users, and what are their requirements?
- Any questions about the requirments, design, and evaluation?

# Project Meeting 4 - second iteration update

## Progress Demonstration

- Please prepare a short demo of the progress so far. 
- This shoud be informal, and no more than 5 minutes.  
- live demo if prefererred, but screen recording and screen shot are also fine.
- This is a good practice for your viva demo

## Questions and Answers

- You can edit this page or email me if there is anything you want to discuss before the meeting, 
- Otherwise I will try to answer your questions then. 

# Project Meeting 5 (final) - final reprot & viva

The meeting will have two parts: 

## Q&A session

Anything related to project, especially the evaluation, final report and viva.

## Evaluation

- Recurit 10-15 people (the more the better);
- Collect some demographic information, such as age, gender, education level, and other things that are important to your app;
- Divide the participants into two groups: one using your app, one without;
- Ask them to complete one or more tasks (exact the same for two groups);
- Record some measurements: such as completion time, accuracy, and quality of the answer;
- Record the process: screen capture video or video recording;
- Compare the 'measurements' from the two groups to see if there is any difference;
- Analyse the recording to see what caused the difference and how it happened;

## Viva
- The actual viva is usally 30 minutes, with 20 minutes presentation & demo and 10 minute Q&A
- The presentation (usually in ppt) covers everything about the project: from introduction and literature reveiw to implemantation and evaluation. Essentilly, it is an overview of your entire project in 15 minutes.
- There is ususally a demo if the project produces some software/app/website. This is your chance to impress the examiners (about the quality of the project outcome), as it provides much more details than the screenshots in the final report. 
- The presentation and demo should be no more than 20 minutes in total, which means about 10 ppt slides. You can mix the two, i.e., including demo during presentation, or do one after the other, e.g., slides first and then demo.
- The last 10 minutes are for the examiner to ask questions. This can be to used to clarify things, ask for missing infomration, ensure you fully understand the work, etc.

For the mock viva, 
- The project doesn't have to be completed; practice with what you have;
- Everyone can ask questions, not just Kai;
- Everyone will provide feedback on how to improve the presentatio and demonstration afterwards.
